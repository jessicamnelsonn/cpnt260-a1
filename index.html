  <h2 class="chester-lake"> Chester Lake 
   <span class="material-symbols-outlined">forest</span>

  <p> <em>Chester lake</em> is a hiking trail found in Kananaskis Country. Itâ€™s 4.6km in length, 300m in elevation, and takes about 1.5 to 2 hours to complete round trip. It is <strong>highly</strong> recommended to check if the trail is closed due to bear activity before heading out. Hikers are advised to bring bear spray, bear bangers or bear bells as Kananaskis is known for its bear activity.</p>

  <p> The trailhead is very easy to find, with a large parking lot equipped with outhouses. This hike is great for beginners as it has mild incline for roughly a kilometer, then flat ground the rest of the way, making it great for children as well.</p> 

  <p>The top of the hike has an astonishing view of mountains with a medium-sized crystal-clear lake filled with plenty of fish, making it a popular spot for anglers. This lake is the only spot in Alberta where anglers can catch <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolly_Varden_trout">Dolly Varden.</a> Native <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westslope_cutthroat_trout">Westslope cutthroat trout</a> can also be found here. </p> 

  <p> This hike is known for being the easiest hike in Kananaskis country, with one of the best views. It can get busy on weekends, so it'd be best to go on a weekday.</p>

  <p class="end-statement"> Happy trails and tight lines to all the fishermen!</p>
